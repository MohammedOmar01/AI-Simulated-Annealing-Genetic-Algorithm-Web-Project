# AI-Simulated-Annealing-Genetic-Algorithm-Web-Project
AI-driven web application optimizes package delivery routes using Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm techniques. It dynamically assigns packages to vehicles based on distance, weight, and delivery priority, aiming to minimize total cost and travel time.
